        <P>I think hard times are coming, when we will be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now and can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies. We will need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries—the realists of a larger reality.</P>

            <p class="b tributeDiv__content">Ursula Kroeber Le Guin was an American author. She wrote a lot o short stories, children's books, poetry and more than twenty novels,
            but she is best known for her works of science fiction as Hainish Universe, and the Earthsea fantasy series. Le Guin was born in Berkeley, 
            California, to author Theodora Kroeber and scholar Alfred Louis Kroeber. Having earned a master's degree in French, Le Guin began doctoral 
            studies, but abandoned these after her marriage in 1953 to historian Charles Le Guin. </p></div>
            
            <div class="b tributeDiv">
            <p class="b tributeDiv__content">She began writing full-time in the late 1950s, and achieved major critical and commercial success with <i>A Wizard of
            Earthsea (1968)</i> and <i>The Left Hand of Darkness (1969)</i>—described by Harold Bloom as her masterpieces. For the latter volume 
            Le Guin won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel, becoming the first woman to do so.</p></div>
            
            <div class="b tributeDiv">
            <p class="b tributeDiv__content">She received numerous accolades, including seven Hugos, six Nebulas, and twenty-two Locus Awards, and was made a <strong>Grand Master of the Science 
            Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America</strong> in 2003, only the second woman so honored. The U.S. Library of Congress named her a <strong>Living Legend</strong> in 2000,
            and in 2014, she won the <strong>National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters</strong>. Le Guin influenced many other authors,
            including Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, David Mitchell, Neil Gaiman, and Iain Banks.</p></div>
            
            <div class="b tributeDiv">
            <p class="b tributeDiv__content">Le Guin was strongly influenced by cultural anthropology, Taoism, feminism, and the writings of Carl Jung. Social and political
            themes, including gender, sexuality, and coming of age were prominent in her writing, and she explored alternative political 
            structures in many stories, notably in the parable <i>The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" (1973)</i> and the utopian novel <i>The Dispossessed (1974)</i>.</p></div>
            
            <div class="b tributeDiv">
            <p class="b tributeDiv__content">Le Guin died on January 22, 2018, at her home in Portland, at the age of 88. A public memorial service, which included speeches by the writers
            Margaret Atwood, Molly Gloss, and Walidah Imarisha, was held in Portland in June 2018.</p></div>
